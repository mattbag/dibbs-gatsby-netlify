### Ever found your favourite bar? 

Where the hallways are dark and long, shafts of light flittering the smoke as you walk along til you realise it's not a bar you've actually walked into a 1920s ballroom hidden in a suburban lot.
As the smoke clears a little you hear a wall of sound wash over and inside you. Remnants of Portishead, Madonna, Nine Inch Nails and King Tubby swirl through the space.

### This is Dive Bell. Welcome.

The band is comprised of 4 divine beings of music who have come together to share their immaculate sounds.Like a well crafted gin, you can't help but fall in love with their melodies and the dreamscapes created in your mind will stay as a lingering memory for all time.
