    “Dive Bell are driven by synths, but also by something deeper and more
    submerged that that. This is precision and dream-state, all sorts of
    evocative, the kind of cinema that makes you want to look away but that you
    can’t stop watching. It’s really bloody impressive.” - The Underground Stage
