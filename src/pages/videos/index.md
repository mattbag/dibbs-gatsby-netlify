**UNDERCOVER**

### "The first ever clip from Dive Bell is a creative exploration of pleasure and pain, intimacy and the cinematic, the intoxicating and the elegiac.

### Pop-infused lyrics soaked in retrospection glue the song together. Combined with slo-mo reveals and the destructive theme of romantic power, it amounts to some absolutely stunning stills that’ll make your jaw drop".

**SLEEP**

**"Sydney’s best-kept secret, Dive Bell, have just released their latest track, Sleep. An immersive landscape of ambient and electronic sounds, frontwoman Aleesha Dibbs’ voice twists and turns at the centre of it all. There’s a beguiling horror to it – and it’s impossible to ever look away. Sleep comes with a video from up-and-coming Sydney director, Maya Luana."**
